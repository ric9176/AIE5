        "- Exact match caching only works for identical prompts\n",
        "- Minor prompt variations result in cache misses\n",
        "- Context-dependent responses may need different answers even for same prompt\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Temporal Relevance\n",
        "- Cached responses may become outdated\n",
        "- Time-sensitive queries need fresh responses\n",
        "- World knowledge becomes stale (especially for current events)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Memory & Storage\n",
        "- Cache size grows with unique prompts\n",
        "- High storage costs for long responses\n",
        "- Memory pressure in production environments\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Cache Key Complexity\n",
        "- Determining effective cache keys is challenging\n",
        "- Need to consider all relevant context\n",
